Currently only tests on your android version have been performed, so give preference to run on it, if you want to test on ios, test at your own risk

You need execute all server commands and leave an instance of it running

After this your can execute

`yarn start` or `npm run start`

and in another terminal

`yarn android` or `npm run android` or `yarn ios` or `npm run ios`

\* you can add a `--reset-cache` after flag `start` if you feel the need
